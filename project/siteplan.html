            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>loveofnailz.com</p>
            <p>This name was chosen because my wife's business is called fortheloveofnailz. I just simplified it because
                it was a little too long.</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>This site will be very friendly and fast, not only from users who use it from a computer, but also from a
                mobile.
                It will help customers to find things quick and be attracted by the design which will create a desire to
                make
                an appointment or buy from the the future store that will be added later, and also is for my wife to
                have less work and instead of using an
                automated
                website with things she doesn't like. She will have the option to choose how it looks.</p>

            <p>What services do you offer?</p>
            <p>How long does an appointment usually take?</p>
            <p>Can I bring my own nail design ideas?</p>
            <p>Do I need to remove my old polish or extensions beforehand?</p>
            <p>What if I’m running late?</p>
            <p>What is your cancellation policy?</p>
